# Approach

My first step was a brainstorm of ideas and creation of user stories.

## User stories

```
As a pharmacist
So I can give the patient the right information about his prescription
I want to be able to access to the Patients Portal

As a pharmacist
So I can see all the patients using the app
I want to be able to search a patient

As a pharmacist
So I can update the patient with specific information
I want to select the patient to send a message

As a pharmacist
So I can provide the right information about patient's prescription
I want to be able to send a message to the selected patient.

```
